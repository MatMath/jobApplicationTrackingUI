# Getting Started
Front-end UI for the the Job tracking app.
Backend is (here)[https://github.com/MatMath/jobApplicationTracking]

### Why/What
Job application tracking can get tedious with applying on different websites, different company, location, and many recruiters that all propose something... So instead of putting everything in a Excel file I wanted to regroup everything.

### Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
Move the dist folder to the backend dist folder so it can be serve & secured.

### Graph:
I don't know D3 really so I had a structure dot-link-force tutorial from: https://github.com/lsharir/angular-d3-graph-example
Also added a simpler BarGraph from: https://github.com/keathmilligan/angular-d3js
